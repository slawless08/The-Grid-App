# The Grid

## Description
A group based social media platform, The Grid solves two problems that popular social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have: the algorithm and advertising. Users are left out from posts from people they are following due to the algorithms that influence their feeds, and advertisements occur every few scrolls. The Grid is first committed to not having an algorithm influence a user's feed, and committed to not displaying advertisements. Additionally, by entering the platform with creating groups, users are able to form their own social context for their platform.
