# The Grid

## Description
A group based social media platform, The Grid solves two problems that popular social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have: the algorithm and advertising. Users are left out from posts from people they are following due to the algorithms that influence their feeds, and advertisements occur every few scrolls. The Grid is first committed to not having an algorithm influence a user's feed, and committed to not displaying advertisements. Additionally, by entering the platform with creating groups, users are able to form their own social context for their platform.

## Current State
The Grid is currently under construction. Current functionality includes landing on the home page to see posts that are seeded in the database. Login, Logout, and signup functionality will be implemented soon. To write your own post, you will have to signup, login, and that will allow the page to display the form to create the post. 

## Future Development
Along with authentication, styling, and basic user interface, future development includes: 

    -Creating your own groups
    -Invite friends to groups by sending a link to their email or phone
    -Customizing group pages and personal profiles
